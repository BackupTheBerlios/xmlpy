<li><p>Introduction</p>
<p>  <strong>XML-based Python</strong> is a XML-based syntax for the object-oriented programming
  language <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> for scripting. The idea is to generate
  XML-based Python programs by XML stylesheet transformations
  (<a href="http://www.w3c.org/)">XSLT</a> and translate the resulting XML document into
  normal Python syntax for execution. One application for this idea are to
  tranform a dynamic HTML template like a "Python Server Page" (PSP) into servlet
  code for an application server for example the <a href="http://webware.sourceforge.net">Webware
  Server.</a></p>

<p>  Look to the following simple example:</p>

<p>  <pre>
  &lt;?xml version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF8"?&gt;
  &lt;!DOCTYPE python SYSTEM "xmlpy.dtd"&gt;
  &lt;python&gt;
    &lt;def name = "fac"&gt;
      &lt;parameter name = "x" default = "1"/&gt;
      &lt;if&gt;
        &lt;condition expr = "x == 1"&gt;
          &lt;return&gt;
            &lt;expr&gt;1&lt;/expr&gt;
          &lt;/return&gt;
        &lt;/condition&gt;
        &lt;else&gt;
          &lt;return&gt;
            &lt;expr&gt;x * fac(x-1)&lt;/expr&gt;
          &lt;/return&gt;
        &lt;/else&gt;
      &lt;/if&gt;
    &lt;/def&gt;
    &lt;print&gt;
      &lt;expr&gt;fac(3)&lt;/expr&gt;
    &lt;/print&gt;
  &lt;/python&gt;
  </pre></p>

<p>  This xmlpy document is equivalent to the following Python program:</p>

<p>  def fac(x=1):
    if x == 1:
      return 1
    else:
      return x * fac(x-1)</p>

<p>  print fac(3)</p>

<p>  This looks quite simple!</p>


</li>
<li><p>XML scheme</p>
<p>  <strong>xmlpy</strong> is defined by a documented XML scheme ("xmlpy.xsd"). Additionally
  there is a DTD ("xmlpy.dtd"). The design principle for the XML scheme is to
  translate all Python statements to XML elements. Expressions can be written as
  usual. The base syntax is Python Version 2.1.</p>
